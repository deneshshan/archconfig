Awesome WM Copycats
===== 
A collection of power themes for Awesome WM 3.5+

Beware! They're more awesome than they appear, it's just they're shy.

Notable features:

- Autohide widgets (*tell me only when you have to*)
- Autostart functionality
- Fast mpd and volume shortcuts (first time you see this trick in Awesome)
- Other fancy shortcuts for copying to the clipboard (goodbye clipboard managers!), toggle wiboxes, widgets popups, screenshots capture, moving clients
- Quake style dropdown terminal
- Calendar with current day highlighted and previous/next month switch with a click 
- Elegant notifications for new mails, current song, volume level, hdd critical state, low battery
- Yahoo Weather integration 
- Net carrier status notifier 
- Full localization potential (just easily edit a few lines - look for 'stub' keywords)
- Colorful autoupdating icons
- Symbolic tag names
- TXT layouts
- PNG taskbar
- No borders when there's only one visible client
- Powerful volume bar
- Custom layouts

They're scattered all over the set, so try each theme and choose the one you enjoy the most.

Notes
--------
**Do not** use without reading and modifying according to your preferences and system specs.

Fonts are Terminus (Multicolor, Powerarrow Darker) and Tamsyn (other ones).

Blackburn and Dremora use Icons_: **if you're running Debian/Ubuntu**, be sure to have bitmaps enabled (1_ 2_).

Except Multicolor and Powerarrow Darker, every theme has a colorscheme_ and uses Yawn_.

**Have any suggestions?** Did you see some great stuff and you want me to put my paws on it? Feel free to email me, it might just be the next copycat!
